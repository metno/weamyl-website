The consortium members are:

* Babeș-Bolyai University (BBU), a public comprehensive university, being today the largest university in Romania and one of the best and most representative Romanian universities.
At national level, BBU has been awarded the title of intensive-research university and was ranked the best Romanian university in the metaranking of CWUR World University Rankings
2019-2020 (https://cwur.org/2019-2020.php). The Computer Science research team from BBU is a research group in ML (MLyRE – www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/ml) from the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science formed by
members with high expertise and valuable scientific results in the artificial intelligence field, particularly in ML. MLyRE mainly focuses on fundamental, applicative and interdisciplinary
research on ML.

* The National Meteorological Administration of Romania (NMA), the Romanian meteorological partner of the Consortium with high expertise in meteorological research (weather
25numerical modelling; climate variability and climate change; physics of the atmosphere and air pollution; remote sensing and GIS) and operational domains. Beside its scientific expertise in
meteorology, NMA has operational experience, being the organisation responsible with issuing severe weather warnings in Romania. 

* The Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET Norway) is a state agency from Norway, a leading international centre of expertise responsible for public meteorological services for civil and
military purposes. It forecasts weather, monitors the climate and conducts research. MET Norway is actively involved in the work of the WMO, the European Centre for Medium Range Weather
Forecasts, and the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). The main research and development activities include atmospheric, oceanic and climatological research and involve both
models and observations. MET Norway has also a long record of participation in regional and EEA/Norway Grant programmes in addition to EU-grants, projects funded by external
organisations, and projects funded by the Norwegian Research Council and the Nordic organisation NordForsk.
